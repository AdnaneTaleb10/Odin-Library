# Odin-Library


## Overview

This project is a library website where users can explore book suggestions displayed as interactive cards. Users can:
- Add or delete books from the collection.
- Mark books as favorites.
- Move books to a reading list by changing icons to indicate their status.

The goal of this project was to create an intuitive and visually appealing interface for managing a personal book collection.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**
- **CSS (Flexbox & Grid for layout)**
